# Resume-Classification-using-ML
This project focuses on helping students improve their chances of securing jobs by analyzing whether their resumes are relevant to specific job descriptions. Many students are unaware if their CV matches the required skills and qualifications demanded by employers. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, the system compares a student's resume with job postings. It highlights areas of improvement and suggests necessary updates. The goal is to make studentsâ€™ resumes more targeted and competitive in the job market.
